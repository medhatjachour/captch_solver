## Introduction

CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether the user is human. This project aims to build a system that can automatically solve CAPTCHA challenges, which can be useful for various applications such as automated testing, data entry, and more.

## Features

- **CAPTCHA Image Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and prepare CAPTCHA images for analysis.
- **Character Segmentation**: Splitting CAPTCHA images into individual characters.
- **Machine Learning Model**: A trained model to recognize characters from the segmented images.
- **CAPTCHA Decoding**: Combining recognized characters to solve the CAPTCHA.
